## Array-CGH data processing
### A series of scripts in python to process raw array-CGH data


The first script (aCGH_01_analysis-per-replica.py) was used in the following publication:


> Yoshido A, Šíchová J, Pospíšilová K, Nguyen P, Voleníková A, Šafář J, Provazník J, Vila R & Marec F (2020) Evolution of multiple sex-chromosomes associated with dynamic genome reshuffeling in *Leptidea* wood white butterflies. *Heredity* **125**: 138-154. doi: https://doi.org/10.1038/s41437-020-0325-9


In case you would like to use the script, feel free to reach out to me for any advice via following email: anna.volenikova@gmail.com.


The rest of the scripts are work in progress, to make data post-processing faster.
